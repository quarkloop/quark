# service-embedding

The embedding service converts text into deterministic local vectors over
gRPC. It is suitable for development, tests, and repeatable local indexing
flows. Online embedding services can implement the same service plugin
contract later.

## Agent Workflows

When indexing documents:

1. Call `embedding_Embed` for every chunk that will be stored in the index.
2. Pass the returned `embeddingRef` to `indexer_IndexDocument.embeddingRef`.
3. Preserve `model`, `provider`, `dimensions`, and `contentHash` as source or
   embedding metadata when useful.

When querying indexed documents:

1. Call `embedding_Embed` for the user query using the same dimensions used for
   indexed chunks.
2. Pass the returned `embeddingRef` to `indexer_GetContext.queryVectorRef`.

## RPCs

- `Embed(EmbedRequest) -> EmbedResponse`
  - Generated service function: `embedding_Embed`
  - Required JSON fields: `input`
  - Optional JSON fields: `model`, `dimensions`
  - The gRPC service returns `vector`, `model`, `dimensions`, `provider`, and
    `contentHash`; the runtime service function returns an `embeddingRef`
    instead of exposing the raw vector to the LLM.

## Contract Notes

- Use consistent dimensions for all chunks and query vectors in the same
  index. The local service owns its configured dimension; leave `dimensions`
  unset unless the user explicitly asks for a configured dimension.
- The local implementation is deterministic and does not call external
  services.
- Do not invent vectors or manually copy vectors; call this service before
  indexing or retrieval and pass the returned reference onward.
