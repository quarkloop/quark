# Quark Agent Instructions

Quark is a Go 1.26 workspace for a local autonomous-agent runtime. Treat this
repository as production-oriented software: no shortcuts, no hidden service
coupling, no DTO leakage across ownership boundaries, and no commits that mix
unrelated scopes.

## Architecture Boundaries

- `supervisor` owns persistent state, spaces, sessions, plugin installs,
  runtime lifecycle, and discovery catalogs.
- `runtime` owns the agent loop, sessions, prompts, tool execution, extraction
  profiles, workspace sidecar policy, and consumption of supervisor-resolved
  catalogs.
- `cli` is an HTTP client. It reads/writes only the local `Quarkfile` and
  delegates all other operations to supervisor or the resolved runtime.
- `services/*` own durable domain behavior behind protobuf/gRPC contracts.
  Services must not call each other.
- `plugins/tools/*` expose agent-callable tool plugins in lib and/or api mode.
- `plugins/services/*` contain service plugin manifests and `SKILL.md`
  guidance for gRPC services.
- `pkg/serviceapi` owns protobuf/gRPC generated contracts.
- `pkg/plugin`, `pkg/space`, `pkg/toolkit`, and `pkg/event` are shared support
  packages.

The agent is the coordinator. For document ingestion it reads files, extracts
structure, embeds chunks, sends canonical records to the indexer, and verifies
retrieval. The indexer stores/query canonical knowledge records only; it does
not parse files, call LLMs, embed text, select schemas, or call another service.

## Modules

The workspace modules are listed in `go.work`:

- `cli`
- `supervisor`
- `runtime`
- `e2e`
- `pkg/event`, `pkg/plugin`, `pkg/serviceapi`, `pkg/space`, `pkg/toolkit`
- `services/build-release`, `services/embedding`, `services/indexer`,
  `services/space`
- `plugins/tools/bash`, `plugins/tools/build-release`, `plugins/tools/fs`,
  `plugins/tools/web-search`
- `plugins/providers/anthropic`, `plugins/providers/openai`,
  `plugins/providers/openrouter`

## Runtime Packages

Important runtime packages:

- `runtime/pkg/agent`: thin orchestrator for session routing and lifecycle glue.
- `runtime/pkg/llm`: bounded LLM/tool loop and streamed tool-call trace events.
- `runtime/pkg/services`: supervisor-resolved gRPC service catalog and generic
  service-backed tool executor.
- `runtime/pkg/extraction`: runtime-owned extraction profiles and open-schema
  validation.
- `runtime/pkg/workspace`: approval-gated sidecar and directory mutation policy.
- `runtime/pkg/pluginmanager`: runtime loading of supervisor-provided plugin
  catalog entries.
- `runtime/pkg/message`, `runtime/pkg/api`, `runtime/pkg/channel/*`: request,
  stream, and channel boundaries.

## Plugins And Services

Everything agent-callable is exposed as a tool surface. Tool plugins own their
schema, implementation, and `SKILL.md`. Service plugins describe gRPC services;
runtime turns their RPC descriptors into generated service tools such as
`embedding_Embed` and `indexer_GetContext`.

Supervisor-owned discovery passes runtime catalogs through:

- `QUARK_RUNTIME_PLUGIN_CATALOG`
- `QUARK_RUNTIME_SERVICE_CATALOG`

Runtime must consume those catalogs as explicit startup input. Do not add
runtime filesystem discovery for supervisor-launched agents.

## Strict Redlines

- Follow `docs/stricts.md` for data-flow ownership.
- Do not pass ingress DTOs into domain packages.
- Do not import another package only to reuse a data shape.
- Copy maps and slices when crossing ownership boundaries.
- Do not mutate user directories during indexing unless the user explicitly
  approves a separate workspace-organization action.
- Do not make services call each other.
- Do not reintroduce a runtime "capability" abstraction. Tools are the only
  agent-callable units.
- Do not hide failures in prompts, tests, or timeout bumps.
- Do not commit changes under `docs/`. The local task tracker and docs drafts
  can change in the workspace, but they must stay out of commits.

## Build And Test

From the repository root:

```bash
make build
make build-plugins
make proto
make test
make vet
make fmt
```

Common focused commands:

```bash
cd runtime && go test ./pkg/agent ./pkg/llm ./pkg/services ./pkg/extraction ./pkg/workspace
cd services/indexer && go test ./...
cd services/embedding && go test ./...
cd plugins/tools/fs && go test ./...
cd e2e && go test -tags e2e -run '^$' ./...
```

Full E2E belongs at the final verification gate after implementation work:

```bash
make test-e2e
go test -count=1 -tags e2e -v -timeout 10m ./e2e
```

## E2E Expectations

E2E tests start real supervisor/runtime/service processes. The standard order
is:

1. build binaries/plugins,
2. start supervisor,
3. create a space through supervisor APIs,
4. install plugins/service plugins through supervisor-owned layout,
5. prepare external dependencies,
6. start runtime,
7. create sessions,
8. send user-style prompts.

Logs must use `[e2e]` prefixes and preserve process ownership. PDF indexing
tests must let the agent read PDFs and use services; tests must not pre-extract
text or construct index payloads.

## Git Rules

- Commit per scope.
- Use conventional messages: `{type}: {description}`.
- Do not include `Co-authored-by`.
- Inspect staged files before every commit.
- Never stage `docs/` changes.
- Do not use destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.
